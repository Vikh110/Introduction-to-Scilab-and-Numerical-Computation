   - Implemented curve fitting, least square fit, and calculated standard deviation using Scilab.

2. **Electrical Engineering Applications**
   - Applied Ohm's law, Hooke's law, and solved linear systems of equations using Gauss elimination and Gauss-Seidal methods.
   - Solved mesh equations of electric circuits using Scilab.

3. **Matrix Operations and Eigenvalue Problems**
   - Diagonalized matrices, found inverses, eigen vectors, and solved eigenvalue problems.

4. **Differential Equations**
   - Solved first-order differential equations using Euler, modified Euler, and Runge-Kutta methods.
   - Addressed second-order differential equations, including harmonic oscillators and damped oscillators.

5. **Partial Differential Equations**
   - Explored various types of PDEs such as wave equations, heat equations, Poisson equations, and Laplace equations.

6. **Scicos/xcos Simulations**
   - Generated and studied waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth), simulated harmonic oscillators, and analyzed heat phenomena using Scicos/xcos.
